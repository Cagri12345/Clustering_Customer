# Clustering_Customer

## Project Overview
This project segments customers using the K-means algorithm and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics based on online retail data to perform behavior analysis. By identifying patterns in customer purchasing behavior, businesses can optimize marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

## Project Details
- **Data Source**: Online retail data from an e-commerce platform (2009-2011).
- **Methods Used**: K-means clustering and RFM analysis.
- **Goal**: To segment customers based on their buying behavior (recency, frequency, monetary) for targeted marketing or personalized services.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by removing missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer.
3. **Data Transformation**: Applying logarithmic transformation to reduce skewness and scaling the data.
4. **Segmentation**: Using K-means clustering to group customers into segments based on their RFM scores.
5. **Analysis and Visualization**: Analyzing the resulting segments and visualizing them to understand customer behavior.

## Key Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For K-means clustering and scaling.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.

## Conclusion
The project provides valuable insights into customer behavior through segmentation, which can be applied to enhance marketing strategies, customer engagement, and overall business performance.
